# QuipBot - A Sarcastic IRC Bot

```quip (verb): make a witty remark```

An intelligent, sarcastic IRC bot powered by OpenAI-compatible APIs that brings personality and fun to your IRC channels. QuipBot can engage in conversations and perform various automated actions while maintaining a witty persona.

## How It Works

The bot is designed to encourage and deliver fun channel conversation by kickstarting and participating in chatter.

Many features can be toggled on and off and specific behaviour may be fine-tuned to suit your requirements, including for specific channels.

By default, the bot will operate like the below:

1. After entering the channel, announce a fun AI generated entrance message

2. Every `idle_chat_interval` seconds, speak a fun conversation starting message if the channel has been idle for more than `idle_chat_time` seconds.

3. Every `random_action_interval` seconds, if the channel has been idle for more than `idle_chat_time` seconds, randomly choose to set a fun AI generated topic or kick a random non-opped (and non-admin) user from the recent chat history (from last `channels.chat_history` lines)

4. Respond when someone speaks to or about the bot and continue chatting every `ai_continue_freq` seconds for `ai_continue_mins` minutes after the last bot mention.

5. Allow ops and admins to use the `@boot` command to randomly kick a non-opped and non-admin user from the chat history with a fun kick message.


## Commands

All commands can be configured to require specific user permissions, being either admin, op, voice, or any.

Admin supercedes op and voice; op supercedes voice; voice supercedes any.

The bot supports the following commands:

- `@boot`: Kick a random non-opped and non-admin user from the chat history with a fun kick message.
- `@topic [topic]`: Set a custom topic if given, otherwise automate a fun AI generated topic for the channel.
- `@sleep <mins>`: Put the bot to sleep for a specified amount of time.
- `@wake`: Wake the bot up from sleep.
- `@say <message>`: Speak a message to the channel.
- `@reload`: Reload the bot's configuration.
- `@die`: Shutdown the bot.
- `@jump [server]`: Jump to a specific server or the next server in the list.
- `@var <variable>`: Print the value of a variable to the log.
- `@config <variable>`: Print the value of a configuration variable to the log.
- `@help [command]`: Show the help message for a given command.
